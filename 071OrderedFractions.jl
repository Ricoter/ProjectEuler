I had the same first try as Harpanet

    Bit of an easy one, this.

    3/7 == 428571/999999.

    Subtract 1 from the numerator.



I realize this is not a general solution

Also, you get closer to the left of 3/7 by increasing the denominator with 1. However, if you subtract 1 from the numerator you should also subtract floor(7/3)==2 from the denominator, which is closer to the left than 428571/1000000.

So the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7 is 428570 / 999997
